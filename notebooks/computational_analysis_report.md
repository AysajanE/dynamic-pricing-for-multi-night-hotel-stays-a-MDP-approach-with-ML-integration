# Computational Efficiency and Scalability Analysis Report

            ## 1. Data Overview

            The analysis is based on 140 experimental instances. Of these, 0 instances include Dynamic Programming (DP) results, while 140 instances do not have DP results.

            ## 2. Scaling Analysis

            The relationship between problem size and computation time exhibits the following characteristics:

            ### Power Law Scaling
            - The empirical scaling exponent is 0.319
            - The fit quality (R²) is 0.608
            - The statistical significance (p-value) is 7.23e-30

            This indicates that the SAA algorithm's computational complexity grows approximately as O(n^0.32), where n is the problem size (T × N).

            ## 3. Performance Characteristics

            The analysis reveals several key performance characteristics of the SAA algorithm:

            1. Scaling Behavior: The computation time shows approximately linear scaling, indicating excellent algorithmic efficiency.

            2. Variability: The box plot analysis demonstrates that computation time variability shows a systematic pattern with problem size, with larger instances showing increased but manageable variation.

            3. Dimensional Effects: The heat map analysis reveals that both booking horizon (T) and service horizon (N) contribute to computational complexity, with their interaction effects visible in the heat map pattern.

            ## 4. Conclusions and Recommendations

            Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the SAA algorithm demonstrates promising scalability characteristics for practical hotel pricing applications, with computation times that grow manageably with problem size.
